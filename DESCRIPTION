Description: A trajectory inference and visualization toolkit 
    for flow and mass cytometry data. flowSpy offers complete 
    analyzing workflow for flow and mass cytometry data. flowSpy 
    can be a valuable tool for application ranging from clustering 
    and dimensionality reduction to trajectory reconstruction 
    and pseudotime estimation for flow and mass cytometry data.
